# Abstract Classes and Interfaces in Python

This repository provides an overview of abstract classes and interfaces in Python.

## Abstract Classes

In Python, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It is used to define common characteristics and behaviors that subclasses should implement. Python provides a module called `abc` (Abstract Base Classes) for defining abstract classes.

### Creating an Abstract Class

To create an abstract class in Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the `abc` module: `from abc import ABC, abstractmethod`.
2. Define your abstract class, inheriting from `ABC`.
3. Use the `@abstractmethod` decorator to mark methods as abstract that subclasses must implement.

Here's an example:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AbstractClassExample(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def method1(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def method2(self):
        pass
