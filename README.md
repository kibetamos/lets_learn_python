## Python Classes

Object - a container that contains data and functionality.

The data represents the object at a particular moment in time.

Data of an object is state. Python uses attributes to model the state of an object.

### Key Points:

- An object is a container that holds both data and functions (methods).
- Attributes are used to represent the state of an object.
- Classes provide a blueprint for creating objects.
- Objects are instances of a class.
- Classes can have methods that operate on object data.
- Constructors initialize the object's attributes.
- Inheritance allows creating specialized classes based on existing classes.
- Encapsulation promotes bundling related data and functions within a class.

Python Classes provide a powerful mechanism for organizing and modeling complex systems by representing entities as objects with their own state and behavior.





## Functionality - Behaviors of an Object

To model behaviors, Python uses functions.

A function associated with an object becomes a method.

An object is a container that contains both state and methods.

Before creating an object, a class has to be designed.

Objects of a class are called instances of the class.

### Key Points:

- Functions associated with objects are called methods.
- Methods define the behaviors or actions that objects can perform.
- Classes provide a blueprint for creating objects with specific behaviors.
- Objects are instances of a class and have access to its methods.
- Encapsulation allows bundling data (state) and methods (functionality) within an object.
- Methods can modify the state of an object.
- Methods can take arguments and return values.

In Python, the combination of state (data) and functionality (methods) in objects allows for the modeling of complex systems and the implementation of object-oriented programming concepts.


#  Example
class Work:<br><br>
    pass<br>
#lets create an instance of a class<br><br>
work = Work()<br>
#this prints the name and the memory<br>
<br>
print(work)<br><br>



## Python Lists

- Lists are ordered collections of elements enclosed in square brackets `[]`.
- Lists can contain elements of different data types.
- Lists are mutable, meaning they can be modified after creation.
- Elements can be added to a list using `append()`, `insert()`, or list concatenation (`+` operator).
- Elements can be updated by accessing them using their index and assigning a new value.
- Elements can be removed using `remove()` to delete a specific element or `del` statement to remove an element at a specific index.




## Summary of Inheritance in Python

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. Some key points about inheritance in Python include:

- Classes can be defined as subclasses of other classes using the syntax `class SubClass(SuperClass):`.
- Subclasses inherit all attributes and methods from the superclass, promoting code reuse and enabling specialization and extension.
- The `super()` function is used to access the superclass and invoke its methods or access its attributes.
- Subclasses can override inherited methods to provide custom implementations.
- Multiple inheritance is supported, allowing a class to inherit from multiple superclasses.
- Inheritance enables polymorphism, where objects of a subclass can be treated as objects of the superclass.
- Inheritance is a powerful mechanism for creating class hierarchies and organizing code in a modular and reusable manner.

By leveraging inheritance, you can create well-structured and flexible Python programs that promote code reuse and extensibility.
