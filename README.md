## Python Classes

Object - a container that contains data and functionality.

The data represents the object at a particular moment in time.

Data of an object is state. Python uses attributes to model the state of an object.

### Key Points:

- An object is a container that holds both data and functions (methods).
- Attributes are used to represent the state of an object.
- Classes provide a blueprint for creating objects.
- Objects are instances of a class.
- Classes can have methods that operate on object data.
- Constructors initialize the object's attributes.
- Inheritance allows creating specialized classes based on existing classes.
- Encapsulation promotes bundling related data and functions within a class.

Python Classes provide a powerful mechanism for organizing and modeling complex systems by representing entities as objects with their own state and behavior.





# Functionality - behaviours of an object<br>
To model behaviours  python uses functions<br>
A function associated with an object becomes a method<br>
an object is a container that contains the state and methods.'<br>
A class has to be designed before creating an object<br>
Objects of a class are called instances of a class<br><br><br>

#  Example
class Work:<br><br>
    pass<br>
#lets create an instance of a class<br><br>
work = Work()<br>
#this prints the name and the memory<br>
<br>
print(work)<br><br>
