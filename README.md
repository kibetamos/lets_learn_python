## Python Classes

Object - a container that contains data and functionality.

The data represents the object at a particular moment in time.

Data of an object is state. Python uses attributes to model the state of an object.

### Key Points:

- An object is a container that holds both data and functions (methods).
- Attributes are used to represent the state of an object.
- Classes provide a blueprint for creating objects.
- Objects are instances of a class.
- Classes can have methods that operate on object data.
- Constructors initialize the object's attributes.
- Inheritance allows creating specialized classes based on existing classes.
- Encapsulation promotes bundling related data and functions within a class.

Python Classes provide a powerful mechanism for organizing and modeling complex systems by representing entities as objects with their own state and behavior.





## Functionality - Behaviors of an Object

To model behaviors, Python uses functions.

A function associated with an object becomes a method.

An object is a container that contains both state and methods.

Before creating an object, a class has to be designed.

Objects of a class are called instances of the class.

### Key Points:

- Functions associated with objects are called methods.
- Methods define the behaviors or actions that objects can perform.
- Classes provide a blueprint for creating objects with specific behaviors.
- Objects are instances of a class and have access to its methods.
- Encapsulation allows bundling data (state) and methods (functionality) within an object.
- Methods can modify the state of an object.
- Methods can take arguments and return values.

In Python, the combination of state (data) and functionality (methods) in objects allows for the modeling of complex systems and the implementation of object-oriented programming concepts.


#  Example
class Work:<br><br>
    pass<br>
#lets create an instance of a class<br><br>
work = Work()<br>
#this prints the name and the memory<br>
<br>
print(work)<br><br>
