We learn python step by step and using real life examples

# Python Classes<br><br>
Object- a container that contains data and functionality.<br>
The data represents the object at a particular moment in time.<br>
Data of an object is state ython uses attributes to model the state of an object.<br><br>
# Functionality - behaviours of an object<br>
To model behaviours  python uses functions<br>
A function associated with an object becomes a method<br>
an object is a container that contains the state and methods.'<br>
A class has to be designed before creating an object<br>
Objects of a class are called instances of a class<br><br><br>

#  Example
class Work:<br><br>
    pass<br>
#lets create an instance of a class<br><br>
work = Work()<br>
#this prints the name and the memory<br>
<br>
print(work)<br><br>
