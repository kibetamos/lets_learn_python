"""
A class in python is defined by the use of a class keyword
E.g class Person:
        pass

classes are callable
we can create an object from from a class.
This is achieved by: using the class name followed by a paranthesis
e.g
    person = Person()-person is an instance of Person
Defining instance attributes
person.name = 'Jonh'
*If we create another another person object, the new object wont have a 
the name attribute.
-TO define and initialize all instances of a class we use the __init__ method
For example:
class Person:
    def __init__(self,age,name):
        self.name =name
        self.age =age

Instance attributes are initialized by the __init__ method, the self is the
self is the instance of the person class.
**#In the __init__ method, the self is the instance of the Person class.
